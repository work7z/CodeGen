CodeGen ToolBox is a secure, efficient, and offline-capable software that provides several useful functions to help reduce your workload and save you time. Our aim is to continuously update and add more useful functions to CodeGen, making coding easier for you.

## About the Repository

We appreciate your interest in the source code of CodeGen ToolBox. However, at this time, we are not able to open the source code for client due to the challenges of managing a contribution community and preventing abuse of the source code from our rivals. We would need sufficient financial support to overcome these challenges before we can consider opening the source code. We appreciate your understanding and support.

Currently, we are only publishing the latest source code for our online system and part outdated source code for toolbox client. For security and competitive reasons, we are not able to publish the client source code. We appreciate your understanding and support.

Lasstly, closed source code software is often backed by reputable companies or organizations that have a vested interest in maintaining the security and reliability of their software. We are firmly convinced that we can have strict policies and procedures in place to prevent backdoors or other security vulnerabilities.
