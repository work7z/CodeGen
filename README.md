# A Letter to CodeGen ToolBox Users  
Greetings from the CodeGen ToolBox team. 

In the midst of this cold winter, we are thrilled to announce that CodeGen ToolBox has released its entire source code and has been renamed to LafTools for a more concise and specific product name. From this point forward, our team will also be known as the LafTools Team.  


Despite our software now being fully open source, we remain committed to serving our premium users as before. We are deeply grateful to those who have shown us their unreserved trust and generous support by upgrading to our premium account. Rest assured, your paid services will remain unaffected, and we are continually exploring ways to enhance this product.  

Our decision to completely open our source code was driven by the following reasons::   
- To conduct a security review 
- To demonstrate the void of malicious logic or backdoors  
- To welcome contributions from the community 
- To build a strong reputation and earn trust.  

We understand your concerns about potential hacking attempts to bypass the activation logic of the software. Indeed, we acknowledge this as a potential issue. However, we have realized that LafTools should thrive by selling services, not just software licenses.

We'd like to remind you below things: 
- Download our software from the official Github repository or our official website.
- Report any security issues you detect.
- Do not hesitate to submit your proposals for UI, tools, development, or any other aspects.

Lastly, we would like to express our gratitude for your time in reading this section.

Thank you!

CodeGen ToolBox is a secure, efficient, and offline-capable software that provides several useful functions to help reduce your workload and save you time. Our aim is to continuously update and add more useful functions to CodeGen, making coding easier for you.

## About the Repository

We appreciate your interest in the source code of CodeGen ToolBox. However, at this time, we are not able to open the source code for client due to the challenges of managing a contribution community and preventing abuse of the source code from our rivals. We would need sufficient financial support to overcome these challenges before we can consider opening the source code. We appreciate your understanding and support.

Currently, we are only publishing the latest source code for our online system and part outdated source code for toolbox client. For security and competitive reasons, we are not able to publish the client source code. We appreciate your understanding and support.

Lasstly, closed source code software is often backed by reputable companies or organizations that have a vested interest in maintaining the security and reliability of their software. We are firmly convinced that we can have strict policies and procedures in place to prevent backdoors or other security vulnerabilities.
